# Discord bot

This bot borrows / has features from other better known bots, such as Echo, MEE6, and the sokoban-Bot. Currently most change and progress goes into the emoji sokoban game. The inspiration / base idea for the Sokoban game comes from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fWdU8JCT6Y). Improvements over the base idea include:
- editing the message instead of sending a new one each update
- different field sizes
- variable player icon (maybe?)
